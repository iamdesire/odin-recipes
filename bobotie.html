            Smooth the top, and simmer mixture gently for 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, add bread to a bowl and cover with 1/2 cup of milk, toss, and let stand for 5 minutes.
            Squeeze excess milk back into the bowl and add soaked bread to meat.
            Mash, smash and stir mixture until bread is thoroughly blended in. </li>

        <li>Add remaining 1 cup milk to the bowl;
